            <p> I feel like this project really helped me to see that I'm using my computer/ the internet mostly for schoolâ€¦
                A lot of the times I switched to tabs I was navigating to Canvas or looking something up for a class. And the other times I was getting on my computer to watch a show or something.

            <p> These are a couple of specific screenshots that I feel embody what I'm talking about. The first image is me in my Computer Science class. In this class we're working with block coding and it can get confusing sometimes so I definitely said "WTF is CS107" because I actually did not know what was happening in class... 
                The second screenshot is me all tucked into bed after finishing homework and stuff. I was going to Hulu so I could watch some SKINS UK before I slept

            <p> I would say this scared cat gif is a pretty accurate representation of my overall feelings about the future of the internet. This is because the cat is scared... things, especially technology wise, move really fast these days and to me that is scary :O</p>
